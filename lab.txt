Question 1: What authentication scheme is used by default in Django Rest Framework's browsable API? How is this managed?
Django Rest Framework uses Basic Auth and Session Auth by default. This is managed in settings.py.

Question 2: What authentication scheme is used by httpie when querying with the -a or --auth option flag?
To authenticate httpie uses a username:password pair when querying with -a or --auth

Question 3: What is the difference between Session Authentication and Token Authentication? How is Token Authentication an improvement over Basic Authentication?
Session auth relies on cookies that store a session id which authenticates the user.
Token auth uses a secret token that is sent with every request to authenticate.

Token auth is an improvement over basic auth as we can choose when a token expires or is generated. This can be done without affecting the user's account.

Question 4: Provide a high level summary of what happens during an OAuth2 authentication flow. For instance: bitbucket.org > Log In > Log in with Google. What happens when I click "Log in with Google"?
-With OAuth2 when "Log in with Google" is clicked an authentication request is sent to the User of the Google account 
-Once accepted by the user, bitbucket would get authenticated to google. 
-Bitbucket would then get an authentication token from Google. 
-Using this token Bitbucket can get resources about the user from Google.
